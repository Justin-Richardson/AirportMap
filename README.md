## Justin Richardson's Airport Map

![Map](https://github.com/Jar3p0/JustinRichardsonAirportMap/blob/main/Images/map.jpg)


In this map, I have made a choropleth out of how many airports are in each indvigual state, and have color coded the markers to represent which airports have air traffic control centers. I have gotten my airport data from data.gov, and am using D3's US geodata. I am also using a simplistic ESRI basemap, and have color coded the states from yellow to green.
